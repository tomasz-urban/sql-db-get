#################################################################################################
NOTE: This project is still in progress !! If You want to see the final version follow my Github!
For now all the code will be written in an unstructured way, just to get the program running. At 
the end I will add some structure to this project and divide it to seperate files.

The aim of this project is to get data from two databases located on two different servers. As an output we get a CSV file with the information that joins the data from those databases.
That information will be gathered periodically and will be used to perform some kind of action.

More details, the kind of output data, the kind of action, will be added with the final version.
